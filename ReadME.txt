=>dataset directory:
It contains the dataset. To load dataset, use load_data.m 
and change any parameter values if required (e.g. mote_id, start/end 
date range).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>baseline:
It contains the implementation of the algorithm proposed by Santini, S., 
& Romer, K. (2006, June), In paper entitled "An adaptive strategy for 
quality-based data reduction in wireless sensor networks", published
In Proceedings of the 3rd international Conf. on networked sensing systems 
(INSS 2006) (pp. 29-36).

=>plot_results:
It constains a script to reproduce Fig. 3 of the baseline and also
the results in my paper "An Adaptive Method for Data Reduction in 
the Internet of Things", Yasmin Fathy, Payam Barnaghi,
and Rahim Tafazolli, the Proceedings of IEEE World Forum on Internet 
of Things, Feb. 2018, Singapore. 


--------------------------------------------------------------------------
=>myapproach_AMDR:
It contains the implmentation of my proposed approch that is presented in
my paper "An Adaptive Method for Data Reduction in 
the Internet of Things", Yasmin Fathy, Payam Barnaghi,
and Rahim Tafazolli, the Proceedings of IEEE World Forum on Internet 
of Things, Feb. 2018, Singapore.
